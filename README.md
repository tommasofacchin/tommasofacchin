# Hey! 👋

I'm Tommaso, a Data Science student at Ca' Foscari University in Venice and a Software Developer at Isoft Srl.

I got into programming back in high school by making games in Unity. That's where I learned C# and realized how much I enjoy coding.

These days I'm deep into machine learning, especially NLP. I like understanding not just how models work, but why they work, so I tend to care a lot about the math, experimentation, and building things end-to-end.

## 🎮 When I'm not coding

You'll probably find me taking photos of the night sky, playing around with freestyle football tricks, or planning my next trip somewhere.

I love cooking and eating food from all over the world. My music taste ranges from country to K-pop and purely depends on my mood.

I like a good whisky with an occasional cigar, and yes, I'm that guy who enjoys wearing a suit even when it's not required.

I also spent a few years as a football referee and working as a waiter, learned a lot about staying calm under pressure and dealing with people!
