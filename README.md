# Hey! 👋

I'm Tommaso, a Data Science student at Ca' Foscari University in Venice. I got into programming back in high school when I started making games in Unity - that's where I learned C# and fell in love with coding.

These days I'm deep in machine learning stuff, particularly NLP. I really enjoy the math behind it all, which makes studying a lot more fun.

## Recent Projects
*(Stars indicate project complexity and proudness)*

**[Transformer from Scratch](https://github.com/tommasofacchin/text-summarization-transformer)** ★★★★☆ - Building a text summarization model with TensorFlow from the ground up. Still a work in progress, but learning a ton about attention mechanisms.  
![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=flat&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)

**[C++ Tokenizer](https://github.com/tommasofacchin/ft-tokenize)** ★★☆☆☆ - Small but efficient tokenizer supporting word-level and BPE tokenization. Written in C++ and usable in Python via PyPI - because sometimes you need that extra speed.  
![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C++-00599C?style=flat&logo=cplusplus&logoColor=white) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white)

**[Ant Colony Optimization Simulator](https://github.com/tommasofacchin/dynamic-ant-colony-optimization)** ★★★☆☆ - Interactive ACO simulation in Unity where virtual ants find optimal paths between food sources. Watching them solve problems in real-time never gets old.  
![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unity-000000?style=flat&logo=unity&logoColor=white) ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-239120?style=flat&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)

**[TikTok Ban - Social Network Analysis](https://github.com/tommasofacchin/TikTok-ban-social-network-analysis)** ★★★★☆ - Analyzed Reddit discussions about the TikTok ban using NetworkX and VADER for sentiment analysis. This was my introduction to social network analysis and NLP - spent a lot of time on it and learned a ton. No AI assistance used, all manual work (which made it pretty challenging).  
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-150458?style=flat&logo=pandas&logoColor=white) 

**[Data Web Mining Project](https://github.com/tommasofacchin/data-web-mining-project)** ★★☆☆☆ - End-to-end data science project with Random Forest and XGBoost models. Classic data cleaning, exploration, and predictive modeling workflow.  
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat&logo=python&logoColor=white) ![Scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Scikit_learn-F7931E?style=flat&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white) 

**[Procedural Tilemap Generator](https://github.com/tommasofacchin/Markov-Wave-Function-Collapse)** ★★★☆☆ - Generates 2D tilemaps using Wave Function Collapse and Markov Chains in Unity. Procedural generation at its finest.  
![Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unity-000000?style=flat&logo=unity&logoColor=white) ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/-C%23-239120?style=flat&logo=csharp&logoColor=white)

**[Soul Hunter](https://tommasodev.itch.io/soul-hunter)** ★★★★★ - Top-down shooter I made in Unity using C#. Free to download on itch.io if you want to check it out!

## When I'm not coding

You'll probably find me taking photos of the night sky, playing around with freestyle football tricks, or planning my next trip somewhere.

I love cooking and eating food from all over the world. My music taste ranges from country to K-pop and purely depends on my mood.

I like a good whisky with an occasional cigar, and yes, I'm that guy who enjoys wearing a suit even when it's not required.

I also spent a few years as a football referee and working as a waiter, learned a lot about staying calm under pressure and dealing with people!
